- ✅ Core business entity management system preserved

### **Impact Assessment:**

#### **1. Positive Changes**
- ✅ Simplified database schema
- ✅ Removed complex billing/invoice management system
- ✅ Reduced database complexity
- ✅ Cleaner data model focused on business entities

#### **2. Application Considerations**
- ⚠️ **Application code updates needed** - Any code that references billing/invoice tables will need to be updated

- ⚠️ **UI components** - Any UI components that display billing/invoice data will need updates
- ⚠️ **Business logic** - Any business logic that depends on these tables will need to be reworked

### **Remaining Functionality:**

- ✅ Document metadata management

### **Next Steps:**

#### **1. Application Code Updates**
- Update any TypeScript interfaces that reference billing/invoice tables
- Refactor API endpoints to remove billing/invoice functionality
- Update UI components to remove billing/invoice features
- Update any business logic that depends on these tables

#### **2. Feature Removal**
- Remove billing/invoice related features from the application
- Update navigation and menus to remove billing/invoice sections
- Update any documentation that references these features

#### **3. Testing**
- Test all remaining functionality
- Verify that business entity management works correctly
- Test any integrations that might have depended on the removed tables

### **Migration Status: COMPLETE**
