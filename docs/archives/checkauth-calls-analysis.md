## Summary

- **Total Active Calls:** 2

- **Documentation References:** 3

## Recent Changes

### Fixed Loading Issues
The following `checkAuth()` calls were **removed** to prevent unnecessary loading states:

1. **SIGNED_IN Event Handler** - Previously triggered on sign-in events
2. **TOKEN_REFRESHED Event Handler** - Previously triggered every ~5 minutes during token refresh

These removals fixed the issue where users would see loading spinners randomly appearing every few minutes.

## Current Behavior

The auth system now only calls `checkAuth()` when:
1. The app initially loads (necessary for authentication)
2. User manually refreshes their profile (via `refreshUserProfile()`)

This ensures a smooth user experience without unnecessary loading interruptions.
