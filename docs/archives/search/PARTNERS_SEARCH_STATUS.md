# 🔍 Partners Page Search Implementation Status

## ✅ **What's Working Now**

### **1. Demo Belgian Company Search**
- **Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **Location**: `/dashboard/partners` search input
- **Functionality**: 
  - Type "Janssens", "Factary", or "Tech" to see demo results
  - Shows realistic Belgian companies with PEPPOL status
  - One-click "Add as Partner" functionality
  - Saves companies to your partners database

### **2. Live Belgian Company Search**
- **Status**: 🚧 **IMPLEMENTED BUT TIMING OUT**
- **Location**: Same search input as demo
- **Issue**: The live API calls timeout due to database query performance
- **Fallback**: Demo results show when live search fails

### **3. Existing Partner Search**
- **Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** 
- **Functionality**: Searches your existing partners by name, email, VAT number

## 🔧 **How to Test**

### **Demo Search (Working)**
1. Go to `/dashboard/partners`
2. Type "Janssens" in the search box
3. See orange Belgian company results appear
4. Click "Add as Partner" to save to database
5. Company appears in your partners list

### **Live Search (Debugging)**
1. Type any company name (e.g., "BVBA")
2. See loading spinner appear
3. After 8 seconds, see timeout message
4. Demo results still show below

## 🎯 **Current User Experience**

**✅ What Users See:**
- Search input works immediately for existing partners
- Belgian companies appear in orange boxes with PEPPOL badges
- Loading indicators show search is happening
- Clear error messages when live search fails
- Demo companies always work for testing

**⚠️ Known Issues:**

## 🔍 **Search Examples That Work**

### **Demo Companies (Always Work):**
- `Janssens` → JANSSENS & CO (Brussels, PEPPOL enabled)
- `Factary` → FACTARY SOLUTIONS (Antwerp, no PEPPOL)  
- `Tech` → TECH INNOVATIONS BELGIUM (Ghent, PEPPOL enabled)
- `Brussels` → Shows companies in Brussels
- `0810` → Shows companies by entity number

### **Existing Partners:**
- Search by company name, email, or VAT number
- Filters by country
- Sorts by various fields

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Search Flow:**
1. **User types** → Debounced after 500ms
2. **Demo search** → Always shows matching demo companies
3. **Live search** → Calls `/api/belgian-company-search` (8s timeout)
4. **Results display** → Orange boxes with company details
5. **Add partner** → Saves to Supabase `customers` table

### **Error Handling:**
- Timeout after 8 seconds
- Clear error messages
- Fallback to demo results
- Console logging for debugging

### **Database Storage:**
```sql
-- Belgian companies saved as:
INSERT INTO customers (
  tenant_id,           -- User's tenant
  name,               -- Company denomination  
  business_name,      -- Same as name
  tax_id,             -- Belgian entity number
  billing_country,    -- 'BE'
  billing_city,       -- Municipality
  status,             -- 'active'
  notes               -- PEPPOL + business details
);
```
