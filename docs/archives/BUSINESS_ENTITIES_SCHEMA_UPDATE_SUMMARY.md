### 10. Database Migration

#### **database/remove_business_entities_fields.sql**
- Created comprehensive migration script to remove all specified fields
- Includes index cleanup and staging table alignment

## Database Changes Required

### **Supabase Migration Steps:**
1. **Run the migration script**: `database/remove_business_entities_fields.sql`
2. **Handle dependencies**: The script drops dependent views (`suppliers_view`, `customers_view`) first
3. **Remove columns**: Drop all specified fields from the table
4. **Recreate views**: Recreate the views with the updated table structure (without removed fields)
5. **Verify table structure**: Check that all fields have been removed
6. **Update any RLS policies**: Ensure policies don't reference removed fields
7. **Test functionality**: Verify all components work with new structure

### **Fields Removed from Database:**
- `email` - Contact email address
- `phone` - Contact phone number  
- `business_name` - Alternative business name
- `billing_state` - Billing state/province
- `status` - Entity status
- `notes` - Additional notes
- `source` - Data source tracking
- `custom_fields` - Flexible metadata storage

### **Indexes Removed:**
- `idx_business_entities_verification_status`

### **Views Updated:**
- `suppliers_view` - Dropped and recreated without removed fields (email, phone, business_name, notes, etc.) - No filtering applied
- `customers_view` - Dropped and recreated without removed fields (email, phone, business_name, notes, etc.) - No filtering applied

## Impact Assessment

### **Positive Impacts:**
- **Simplified Schema**: Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Consistent Naming**: All business entities now use only the `name` field
- **Cleaner UI**: Removed unused form fields and display elements
- **Reduced Data Storage**: Less data to store and manage

### **Data Loss:**
- **All email addresses** stored in business entities
- **All phone numbers** stored in business entities
- **All business names** (alternative names)
- **All notes** and additional information
- **All PEPPOL metadata** stored in custom_fields
- **All industry information** stored in custom_fields
- **All legal form data** stored in custom_fields

### **Functionality Changes:**
- **Search**: No longer searches by email or business name
- **Forms**: Simplified business entity forms
- **Display**: Cleaner partner and business listings
- **Admin**: Reduced information in admin dashboard

## Testing Recommendations

### **Required Testing:**
1. **Business Entity Creation**: Test form submission without removed fields
2. **Search Functionality**: Verify search works with remaining fields
3. **Partner Management**: Test partner listing and management
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Verify admin functionality works correctly
5. **Data Migration**: Test the database migration script

### **Rollback Plan:**
1. **Database Backup**: Ensure backup exists before migration
2. **Code Reversion**: Keep previous code version for rollback
3. **Data Recovery**: Plan for data recovery if needed
